# Lecture-Link

Lecture Link is a student portal I built to practice web development and deployment.  
It allows students and lecturers to easily access and share course materials online.

# Features  
- User signup and login system  
- Lecturers can upload and view course files  
- Students can sign in to view materials only (no upload access)  
- Simple and responsive design  
- Hosted online so it works without setup  


# Tech Used  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)  
- Render (for hosting and deployment)  


# Why I Built This  
I wanted to work on a project that feels close to a real-life system used in schools.  
It also gave me the chance to learn more about authentication, access control, and cloud deployment.  

Since it is hosted on GitHub and deployed on Render, it also shows how version control, collaboration, and reproducibility can be applied, which are important concepts in both software projects and research work.  


# Next Steps  
- Organize files by course and level  
- Improve authentication and security  
- Connect to a database for persistent storage  
- Explore scalability and advanced cloud features
